## Outside resources

+ Working with time: https://www.w3schools.com/php/func_date_date_format.asp#:~:text=H%20%2D%2024%2Dhour%20format%20of,leading%20zeros%20(00%20to%2059)

+ Descriptive text for locations is copied or modified from the associated websites (urls included for each location).

## Notes for instructor
+ I struggled to make the checkboxes persist when I was relying on the json data to compose the checklist. I struggled on this too long on my own and wish I'd posted in the forum.
+ I intentionally set up the form to be somewhere other than initial index page because I envision expanding this to other locations
+ In the next version, I'd like to:
++ factor in a lunch break
++ work in custom error validation: if time required to visit the locations is more than the time available based on the length of the trip
++ factor in how close locations are to each other in determining what the next location should be
